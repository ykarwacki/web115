					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

						<h2 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">How is repair different from restoration?</h2>
					  	<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--11-col mdl-cell--1-offset">
					  		
							<p>Restoration is returning your piece as close to its historically original state as possible. Only necessary repairs are done, and as much as possible, original techniques and materials are used. We are well versed in a number restoration methods including French polish refinishing.</p>
		
					  	</div>
						<h2 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">How can I get an estimate for restoration?</h2>
					  	<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--11-col mdl-cell--1-offset">
					  		
							<p>You can email us with a description of the piece or pieces in question and your contact information. Including as many relevant photos is a great help to us. Feel free to use the online contact form.</p>
		
					  	</div>
						<h2 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">How do I know if a piece is worth restoring?</h2>
					  	<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--11-col mdl-cell--1-offset">
					  		
							<p>Many times the decision is more emotional than economic, and we are happy to help you transform any treasure regardless of its monetary value. That said, send us the details of your piece. Be sure to include whatever you know about the age and origin of the piece and include as many photos of its current condition as possible. And we can generally give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of any potential for financial return.</p>
		
					  	</div>
						<h2 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">What is French polishing?</h2>
					  	<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--11-col mdl-cell--1-offset">
					  		
							<p>French polishing is a traditional polishing technique where several layers of shellac are rubbed into the wood grain. This results in a high gloss finish without the plastic shell appearance that results from modern acrylic treatments. Full restoration of antiques frequently requires French polishing, and few craftspeople are trained in it. It is considered a dying art.</p>

						<h2 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">What is woodworm, and what can be done about it?</h2>
					  	<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--11-col mdl-cell--1-offset">
					  		
							<p>Wood furniture of any age is susceptible to attack from the furniture beetle otherwise known as woodworm. If you notice small unexplained holes in your furniture, you can test it for infestation. Place a sheet of newspaper under the affected area and periodically strike the area of the furniture sharply. If this results in small piles of sawdust on the paper, there is a good chance the piece has woodworm and should be professionally treated. Until treatment is completed it is best to seal the piece in plastic and store it out doors to avoid affecting other furniture.</p>
