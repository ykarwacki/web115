       							 	<p>It makes sense that growing crops indoors has always resulted in higher yields. This approach allows fine tuning the environment to meet the plant's every need and protect it from bad weather and pests. The major obstacle has always been the energy consumed running the artificial lighting.</p>
									<p>With the pace of improvements in alternative energy and efficient lighting constantly accelerating, This is less of an obstacle by the second. And our ability to feed the world in the near future may depend on it. If you're knew to the idea of Controlled Environment Agriculture, less formally known as vertical farming, we recommend clinking the button here to find out what Dickson Despommier has to say about it.</p>

							<p>We were very sad to here of Chicagoland's own FarmedHere going out of business, both because it was local and because that's one less vertical farm. But since then, I've been approached by several people in the local, larger urban farming community who want to suggest that the failure of Farmed Here is evidence of the non-viability of vertical farming.</p>
							<p>Here at Vertical Farming News we completely disagree. Farmed Here didn't make it because of an unfortunate mixture of overextension and family conflict, reasons many businesses don't make it. Plenty of other indoor farms are staying afloat, and worldwide, more farms join their ranks everyday, including . . .</p>
							
							<p><bold>Plantagon CityFarm</bold> in Stockholm, Sweeden. Their plan is to build a total of ten farms near Stockholm in the next three years where up to 70 tons of food will be grown and while saving 99% of the water used in traditional farming methods. The first three farms are already privately funded, but to speed things along they are running a crowd funding campaign at</p>

							<p>One obstacle that new vertical farms consistently face is a shortage of qualified workers. To address this problem some new programs are openning up, starting with schools with a pre-existing strong relationship with agriculture. Here are four of the best, strongly focused on CEA so far - Three in the US and one in the UK:</p>

								<h6>Greenhouse Crop Production & Engineering Design Short Course</h6>

								<h6>Market Gardener Training Program</h6>
								<p>The primary focus here is on outdoor soil based agriculture in an urban environment. All the same, there's plenty of good science here on the needs of crop plants and how to efficiently use space. Additionally, some attention is always given sustainable innovation.</p>

								<h6>School of School of Integrative Plant Science</h6>
								<p>Right now this isn't really a program as much as a research project with a good size grant. But it's probably worth paying attention to, because the goal is to compare <em>every </em>aspect of CEA to it's traditional agricultural counterpart to reach a supported conclusion about the long-term viability of indoor farms. And part of their mission is to develop training programs.</p>
