			<p>Complete setups like the one shown to the left are great for brewing at home, but few home brewers start all grain brewing with such a ready made setup - mostly because of cost concerns. A complete stainless steel brewing kit typically goes for $2000 - $3000.</p>
			<p>Regardless of the means available, the functions of the three kettles shown must be filled in any all grain brewing system. Starting from the left, are the brew kettle, the mash tun, and sparge water tank. Here, each has its own propane burner which is not always possible.</p>

						<p>Many brewers upgrade to a quality stainless steel boil pot before doing their first all-grain brew. If you have not, now is the time. There is no way around buying this and investing in quality. To accomodate the most common recipe size of 5 gallons, you will need something with at least 8 gallons capacity although it's probably best to just go with a 10 gallon. Stay away from aluminun and bare regular steel as they will impart a noticable metallic taste the beer. You can use a steel canning pot with an enamel finish, but the enamel generally begins to chip pretty quickly resulting in bare steel being exposed to the brew. Copper would be fantastic, but can be expected to be even more expensive than stainless steel.</p></div>

					<p>The mash tun is also frequently called the lauter tun, because ideally you will mash and lauter the grain in the same vessel. The best vessel is another stainless steel kettle that has been modified to have a false bottom with even drainage and a ball spiggot attached to the side near the bottom. Kits for converting a regular kettle to a mash/lauter tun are widely available and can save quite a bit.</p>
					<p>A time honored tradition among cash-strapped new brewers is to make a lauter tun by modifying an insulated plastic cooler. These can work great and can double as a mash tun as long as most of your grain bill consists of fully modified malt that can be held at a single mash temperature. The disadvantage becomes clear when a beer requires a two step mash with a protein rest at lower temperature. Some people will address that issue by mashing stove stove top in their brew kettle and then scooping mash into the lauter tun. And that works, but it is a process that will make you wish for stainless.</p>

					<p>The highest level kettle in the three tiered brew system holds the sparge water to be gently poured over the mash at tmperatures just below boiling. The best choice here is stainless steel similar to the mash tun only without the false bottom. And surprise - coolers are frequently used in a pinch.</p>

						<p>Good results in both the mash and the lauter require that the grain is evenly crushed into particles that are small but not so small that it could be described as flour. Investing in your own grain mill can probably be put off since most brew shops will mill grain for their customers, in many cases even if you have not made a purchase the same day. Sooner or later you will want to save yourself the extra trip. There are plans with a variety of designs to build your own, models like the one pictured here are reasonably priced and give a very precise grind.</p></div>

						<p>In a good sparge, hot water trickles slowly and evenly through the entire grain bed. It is important to avoid tunnels created by water pressure. To control water flow, the sparge water is drained through some type of tubing with openings similar to a sprinkler. There are countless designs for these and you can easily make your own, but they are also not terribly expensive.</p>

						<p>When brewing with malt extract, it is common to do a three gallon boil then cool the wort by adding two gallons of cold water. With all grain brewing this is not an option. In order to quickly chill your hot wort to yeast pitching temperatures and minimize the risk of infection with unwanted wildpanel-body or bacteria, you will need a wort chiller.</p>
						<p>There are two types of wort chillers: immersion and counter-flow. Both can be purchased or made reletively easily. An immersion chiller is simply a large coil of 1/4 inch copper pipe with a hose attachment allowing cold water from the sink to run through the pipe. The pipe is immersed in the hot wort while cold water travels through the copper pipe and carries the heat away with the water. These are easy to make, maintain and clean since only water travels through the inside of the pipe.</p>
						<p>A counter-flow chiller is more like two chillers running in opposite directions: one inside the other. On the inside there's a copper pipe that the wort flows through, and around the pipe, there is a garden hose that cold water runs through in the opposite direction. These are also easy enough to make or buy, but harder to cleaner. Brewers who favor this type of wort chiller frequently site the ease with which the chilled wort can be filtered as it exits the chiller.</p>
