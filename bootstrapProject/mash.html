							<p class="lead">1.  What is it?</p>
							<p>Mashing is the process of mixing the crushed malt with water and holding the mixture at specific temperatures in order to activate enzymes in the malt. A single step mash has only a saccharification rest where enzymes convert starches into fermentable sugars. A two step mash features adds a protein rest where protein is broken down to polypeptides and amino acids.</p>	
						</li>
        				<li class="list-group-item">
							<p class="lead">2.  What kind of mash tun are you using?</p>
							<p>If you're using a converted cooler as a mash tun, you might consider limiting yourself to fully modified malt even when a beer style would typically call for an undermodified one. You'll need to use a bit more malt per gallon, but the change in flavor will be extremely subltle and you'll make your life much easier.</p>
							<p>Undermodified malts can be used with a converted cooler used only as a lauter tun. You will need to do the mash stove top in a separate pot and then scoop the finished mash onto a bed of hot water a cup or two at a time.</p>
						</li>
        				<li class="list-group-item">
						<p class="lead">3.  What's in your grain bill?</p>
						<p>If the total percentage of protein in your grain bill is between nine and eleven percent you can probably skip the protein rest with out suffering the consequences of too much unbroken down protein such as excessive haze and poor head retention. Otherwise, you will want to begin your mash with a protein rest around 125 degrees F.</p>

      				<ul class="list-group">
        				<li class="list-group-item">
						<p class="lead">1.  Decide the holding temperature of the first step of the mash.</p>
						<p>If you're doing a protein rest, your first rest will be around 122 degrees F. That temperature allows the maximum breakdown of proteins. You can use water at any temperature below this since you will be applying external heat.</p>
						<p>For a single step mash, you'll want to aim for a temperature between 150 and 158 degrees F. Temperatures higher in that range favor fuller bodied beers with more residual unfermentable sugars. While temperatures lower in that range will maximize fermentable sugars. If you cannot apply heat to your mash tun, you will need to heat the mash water to 16-18 degrees F above the desired mash temperature.</p>	
						</li>
        				<li class="list-group-item">
						<p class="lead">2. Measure the water.</p>
						<p>You'll need about 1 quart for every pound of crushed malt, and it should be properly treated in whatever way you have determined is appropriate for your water. Add the water to your mash tun before the malt unless you want to deal with something like pizza dough along the way.</p>	
						</li>
        				<li class="list-group-item">
						<p class="lead">3.  Consider your equipment</p>
						<p>If you can't apply heat to your mash tun, you will need to heat the total amount of your mash water to 20 degrees F above the target temperature of the rest before adding everything to the mash tun. The temperature should settle quickly to something near the target.</p>

						<p class="lead">1. With a protein rest</p>
						<p>You can start with any temperature water below the target temperature, because you will be applying external heat. Monitor the temperature closely: it may be changing slowly but with the volume of mash you'll be cooking it will be just as difficult to cool the mash. As the mash reaches appropriate temperatures for the protein rest, adjust the heat source to maintain temperatures around 122 degrees F for 30 minutes. You may even need to turn the heat off for a while, but turn it back on if the temperature drops too much before the end of the protein rest.</p>
						<p>After a half hour, the proteins should be well modified. Raise the mash temperature to the target saccharification rest temperature and hold it there. This rest will take 30 - 90 minutes with the time being strongly dependent on the holding temperature. Knowing when to stop will be discussed shortly.</p> 	
						</li>
        				<li class="list-group-item">
						<p class="lead">2.  Without a protein rest</p>
						<p>If you're using a boil kettle mash tun, the proceedure is the same as with a protein rest - only skip the first temperature range.</p>
						<p>Part of the beauty of converted coolers as mash tuns is that they hold heat fantastically. And once the mash in is done, You can seal the cooler up and walk away for an hour or so. Stir the grist into the heated water well, check the temperature, and if it's too low add small amounts of boiling water until the desired temperature is reached.</p>
						</li>
        				<li class="list-group-item">
        				  <p class="lead">3.  When to stop</p>
        				  <p>You'll need tincture of iodine, which you can sometimes find at the drug store. If not, betadine will work. The smallest available bottle should last quite a while.Iodine solutions turn from a reddish-brown to a deep purple in the presence of dissolved starch.</p>
						<p>To test your mash for completion</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Take some liquid from the mash and place it on a white or light colored plate.</li>
								<li>Make sure you have only liquid. Solid particles will give a false negative indicating incomplete. If there are particles to remove, don't use your fingers. That could also change the results.</li>
								<li>Place a drop of the iodine next to the mash liquor and carefully mingle the two liquids by tilting the plate. If there is a pronounced and rapid color change to dark purple, starch is present and your mash is not complete. Wait at least 15 minutes to test again. If the mash has already been longer than 90 minutes, especially if the color change is not immediate, it's best to assume that the test isn't doing much good and end the mash anyway.</li>
								<li>Results can be hard to see if you're working on a darker colored beer. In this case, it's usually best to spread the mash liquor over a larger area before adding the iodine.</li>
