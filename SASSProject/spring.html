			<h4>When:</h4>
			<p>As soon as there is a first complete thaw of snow and frost. In very mild climates this could even be as early as January.</p>
			<h4>Where:</h4>
			<p>Well hydrated soil with or without drainage from sand. So, the edges of creeks and marshes are great.</p>
			<h4>What:</h4>
			<p>Like all bulb plants, first growth is a narrow leaf that reasembles thick grass. Of course, the root will feature the characteristic bulb. The most important thing is that it smells like onion and/or garlic. There are countless highly toxic look alikes. The aroma is the cue that you've found the real thing.</p>
