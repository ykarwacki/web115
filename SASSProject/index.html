		<h2>Why Forage Wild Plants?</h2>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34MFfMGQF44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			
			  <p>In this YouTube video Jason Irving discusses foraging by chefs and hobbiests in London, but the cultural attitude in North America is very similar with recent interest in feeling close to nature and knowing where your food comes from. He also mentions some basic and very important safety concerns. Hopefully it goes without saying, but don't eat any wild plants simply because they resemble the ones he shows especially if you're outside the UK where the chances of getting the same species would be considerably lower.</p>

		<h2>Safety Rules</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>
		  <h3>Never eat anything until you're sure of its identity.</h3>
		  <p>Plenty of edible plants are very similar in appearance to extremely toxic plants. This is especially true if some strongly indentifying feature, such as distinctly flowers, is not in season. Know what you hope to find before you set out and research it throughly. It is worth investing in a decent field guide, such as <i>Peterson's Guide to Wild Edible Plants</i>. Many foragers with years of experience still make a point of carrying such a refernce. Be extra careful if you plan to harvest mushrooms. If you're a beginner, try to find a local foraging club and listen critically to how those with more experience describe their backgrounds. If you have any doubt at all about something's ID, DO NOT eat it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<h3>Learn the right way to use a plant.</h3>
			<p>Not every part of a plant is always edible. Sometimes one part is fine to eat but another part could be deadly or make you very sick. Some plants should only be eaten during certain times of the year. Many are harmful if eaten raw but fine once cooked. Some even have to be cooked in very specific ways to be safe. Include this in your pre-foraging research just as you would identification information.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Avoid harvesting in areas where contamination is likely.</h3><p>Certainly, avoid plants growing in or near abandoned industrial sites, but plants in cemetaries should also raise suspicions because of the toxicity of embalming fluid. How safe are nearby water sources? If a nearby river is polluted by a factory 20 miles upstream, you should consider the plants polluted as well. Take the time to know what pesticides and herbicides have been used on the land and how long it's been since they were used. This is particulary a concern in urban parks. It's best if an area has been free of pesticide use about 10 - 15 years.</p><p> Be aware of naturally occuring contamination as well. Avoid areas known to be favorites of dogs or cats and areas that may have a problem with rats. Wash everthing throughly no matter where it was harvested. Cooking usually adds additional protection from disease and parasites.</p></li>
			<li>
			<h3>Limit your exposure to new plants.</h3>
			<p>It is possible to have an allergic reaction to anything and to develop a new allergy at any point in life. As you start foraging you will come in contact with plant species that you've not only never eaten but possibly never touched. Limiting the amount of a plant won't prevent an allergic reaction but it may limit the severity if one occurs. Don't mix new plants with other foods at first. If you do have any kind of bad reaction, you'll be better able to identify the source.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<h3>Respect the land and the law.</h3>
			<p>Always get permission to forage anywhere other than your own land. In general, assume that it is strictly forbidden in any type of conservation area, although in some cases park rangers will be happy to allow it if your target is an invasive species. Ask first and respect the answer.</p>
			<p>Harvest sustainably. Take only a small portion of a plants growth in an area. Some foragers will recommend no more than 10% to 25% of the available material, but this number could go up or down a bit depending on how quickly the species recovers and how many people forage in your area.</p>
